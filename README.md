The goal of this project is to create a recommender system for a user based on his download and browsing history. To date, there are over 97 million songs written with a new song being written every two minutes. As the usage of MP3 files has increased over the years,it has now become common to include the metadata (ID3 tags) of the mp3 data in these files.
